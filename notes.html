Week 1
----------------------------------------
  |localStorage| methods are |setItem(key, value)|,
  |getItem(key)|, |removeItem(key)|, and |clear()|


### Mobile-first Design
 - Know your users better than they know themselves.
 - Number of taps affects users' perception of speed.
 - Google: 1/2 second delay = 20% drop in traffic.
 - Bing: 2 second delay = 4% drop in revenue.
 - AOL: Fastest 10% of users stay 50% longer.
 - Remember single-hand position "reachability" for mobile design.
 - For ads on mobile, consider having the ad behind the content and (a) gap(s) in
      the content so that a small window scrolls past the full ad without consuming
      screen real estate; it also looks unique and interesting.

Question: What would localStorage be used for in a legit app other than keeping a
    user's username and maybe a screen arrangement of some sort?  It seems that
    everything else should persist on the server.

Week 2
----------------------------------------
### Chapter 2: Programming Basics
Reserved words:
  |
    abstract, await, boolean, break, byte, case, catch, char,
    class, const, continue, debugger, default, delete, do,
    double, else, enum, export, extends, false, final, finally,
    float, for, function, goto, if, implements, import, in,
    instanceof, int, interface, let, long, native, new, null,
    package, private, protected, public, return, short, static,
    super, switch, synchronized, this, throw, throws, transient,
    true, try, typeof, var, volatile, void, while, with, yield
  |

Not reserved, but should be: |undefined, NaN, Infinity|

|let| prevents overwriting any built-in methods

|String#trim()| removes leading and trailing whitespace

<code>|</code> is used for _**"template literals"**_ to allow line breaks and interpolation.

|symbol| is a primitive datatype added by ES6 somewhat similar to a
    string<br>
    |Symbol.for(<unique ID : string>)| returns a |symbol| defined by a
    unique ID<br>
    The main use-case for symbols is as object property keys, which will be covered
    in Chapter 5. The uniqueness of symbols, mean that itâ€™s impossible for the names
    of any properties to clash with each other if they are symbols
    (more info on [Sitepoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/es6-symbols-uses/)).
    
Numbers:
 - |0xAF| hexadecimal (base 16) notation starts with |0x|
      (more info on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal))
 - |0o47| octal (base 8) notation starts with |0o|
 - |0b1010| binary (base 2) notation starts with |0b|
 - |1e6| or |1E6| exponential notation starts with |<number>e<power></number>|

Some Number methods:
 - |Number#toExponential()|
 - |Number#toFixed([<num digits>])|
 - |Number#toPrecision(<num digits>)| like |.toFixed()| but
    omits trailing 0s
 - |Number.isFinite(<number>)</number>|

|2**3| for exponentiation (same as "=2^3" in Excel)

|Infinity| / |-Infinity| error value for a number that is too big/small for JavaScript
  (or by dividing by 0)

|==| is known as soft equality  
|===| is known as hard equality  
|Number.isNaN(<value>)| (ES6) only returns |true| for |NaN|,
    and is necessary because |NaN === NaN| returns |false|    
|isNaN(<value>)| (old global function) returns |true| for a |string|

There are 6 primitive data types: |strings|, |symbols|, |numbers|, |Booleans|, |undefined|, and |null|.  
Non-primitive data types, such as arrays, functions and objects, all have a type of |object|.  
falsy values: "", '', \`\`, 0, -0, |NaN|, |false|, |null|, |undefined|

### Chapter 3: Arrays, Logic, and Loops
***Array:***  
Destructuring: |const [x, y] = myArray;|  
|Array#concat(<itemOrAnotherArray>);| is the older version of the spread operator
    |[ ...myArray, ...anotherArray]|  
|Array#slice(start[, end])| returns subarray  
|Array#splice(start[, deleteCount[, item1[, item2[, ...]]]])| removes items from an array
    (and returns them), optionally adding new items

***Set:***  
|const mySet = new Set();| for unique values, but does not allow square bracket notation
    (seems to be a tree).  
|Set#has()| is faster than |Array#includes()| or |Array#indexOf()|  
Objects (incl. Arrays) are always considered unique by a Set.  
A string passed into the constructor will be split into letters, but |Set#add()| will add
    the string without splitting it.  
A Set can be converted to an Array using the spread operator.  
|WeakSet| can contain only objects, and  object in WeakSet can be garbage collected if
    there is no other reference to it.  

***Map:***  
Key can be any data type (not just string, as is the case for an Object).  
|Map#size| indicates number of properties.  
Use |Map#get()| instead of dot/square bracket notation.  
A Map can be converted to an Array using the spread operator.  
|WeakMap| lacks the |size| property.

|for-of| loop iterates over a Objects, Sets, and Maps in the order elements were added.
